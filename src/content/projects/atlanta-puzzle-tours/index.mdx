## Overview

Released in 2022 and revamped in 2023, Atlanta Puzzle Tours is a side project my wife and I started for fun, where we create self-guided tours through interesting parts of Atlanta.

**The fun twist:** users must solve a series of puzzles and riddles along the way in order to unlock each new step. It‚Äôs basically brainteasers, trivia, and outdoor fun all in one!

I created the entire project ‚Äî the concept, logo, website UI design, puzzle logic, APIs and underlying architecture, the backend reporting dashboard, everything ‚Äî from scratch, and it‚Äôs been a blast seeing how much fun people have with it! üòÅ

The project took inspiration from Jackbox Games, where any number of players can join using a randomly generated 4-digit code, which lasts for 48 hours. Then, as players solve each puzzle and continue through the tour, their collective progress is saved all the way to the end.

To help manage the project and keep track of tours, players, feedback, and any reported problems, I also create a backend dashboard to query the data for all the tours from the MongoDB database and display a table and charts with relevant data for each tour.
