## Overview

Titanium is a framework for building cross-platform native mobile applications using a single JavaScript codebase.

I worked with the Titanium team at Axway to design the official new &ldquo;microsite&rdquo; for Titanium &mdash; a subdomain of the main Axway website that would serve as the introduction and documentation hub for out Titanium product.

This new design was drafted (<a href='https://bbag.github.io/titanium-site/' target='_blank'>demo here</a>) entirely by me, from pure HTML, CSS, and JS &mdash; no CMS or frameworks used. Components were designed for the final site to be built in VuePress.
